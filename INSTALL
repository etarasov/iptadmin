Notes for debian-based distributions
----------------------------------
In some linux distributions, for example, debian and ubuntu,
there is no "/etc/init.d/iptables save" script by default.
And there is no mechanism for saving netfilter configuration.
That's why user should manually setup a saving procedure.
The article http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/445 can help to do this.
After setting up saving procedure the file /etc/iptadmin/iptadmin.conf
should be configured.  The parameter "save command" should be set up to something like
"iptables-save > /etc/firewall.conf". It's the command for
saving filrewall rules to a file which is read by iptables on startup.

You can set 'save command' to 'echo' for testing purposes.
But rules won't be saved after reboot in this case.
